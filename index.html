            <p>Technology plays a huge role in our daily lives, from the simplest of apps to the most groundbreaking
                inventions. Every
                website or piece of software that we encounter has been built by a web developer—but what exactly is web
                development,
                and what do they do? All of this will be answered in this guide to how to become a web developer.</p>

                “It doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down. All that matters is you get up one more time

                knocked down.”

                "The trouble with not having a goal is that you can spend your life running up and down the field and
                never score."
