            <p>Technology plays a huge role in our daily lives, from the simplest of apps to the most groundbreaking
                inventions. Every
                website or piece of software that we encounter has been built by a web developer—but what exactly is web
                development,
                and what do they do? All of this will be answered in this guide to how to become a web developer.</p>

                “It doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down. All that matters is you get up one more time
                than you were
                knocked down.”

                "The trouble with not having a goal is that you can spend your life running up and down the field and
                never score."

            <p>No one can become perfect in just one day. Only Practice makes a man perfect. But now the phrase is
                changed; only
                perfect practice makes the difference. You must strive for progress and not perfection. Progress happens
                with more and
                more practice. You need a lot of practice to master something.</p>
